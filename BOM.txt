If you'd like to do a 1:1 recreation of what I've made, these are the part numbers for the components I used. All parts were purchased on Mouser, with the exception of the pro micro and its PCB leg headers (both sourced via aliexpress).
I'll provide the manufacturer product numbers for each component, rather than the mouser number, should you prefer another vendor such as DigiKey or LCSC.
1 PCB (from JLC, using the board files here)
1 Potentiometer - PTV09A-4015F-B102
6 tactile switches - FSM6JH
1 10 hole terminal block - TB001-500-10BE
5 through hole resistors (I used 220 ohm but I'd recommend going higher, mine are almost blindingly bright)- CFR-25JT-52-220R
5 LEDs (Accidentally ordered oval ones, but just about any 5v LEDs will work just fine)- C4SMF-BJF-CR24Q4T2
