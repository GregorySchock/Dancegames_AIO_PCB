# Dancegames_AIO_PCB
PCB that can control all necessary aspects of hooking up a set of sensors to a PC in order to play games such as DDR and PIU

Made to have an arduino pro micro (or compatible) board inserted in the corner. Also has a set of buttons and LEDs to assist in calibration, if using velostat sensors that support automatic calibration routines. See my other repos for that code, if interested.
